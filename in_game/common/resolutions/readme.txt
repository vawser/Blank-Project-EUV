# International Organization Resolution system - create a resolution entirely in script and place a GUI button for it entirely in script - no need for coders!
#
# This is the resolution script. In addition to adding a resolution here, you'll need strings for the name (tag is the <action_tag>) and description (tag is <action_tag>_desc)
#
# - loc <string>: [optional] base loc key for everything to do with this resolution (if not specified, it will be the resolution key)
# - potential <trigger>: can this be shown. scope:actor is the country attempting to perform the action
# - allow <trigger>: is this enabled. scope:proposer is the country attempting to initiate the action; scope:recipient is the international organization
# - can_vote <trigger>: can actor vote. scope:actor is the country testing if it can vote or not; scope:recipient is the international organization
# - is_live <trigger>: is this resolution active. Used for elections mainly. If a resolution is live, then it will be tested to see if it can be finalized.
# - proposal_price <scriptedprice>: listed in \common\prices\ and referenced by name (like price:<price_id>) or as a result of a script (like scope:target.price)
# - proposal_price_modifier <script value>: multiplies the price; scope:actor is the country, scope:recipient, scope:target, scope:target_1, scope:target_2....etc
# - proposal_payer <scripted country>: script to determine who is paying the price. By default, the proposer
# - proposal_payee <scripted country>: script to determine who gets paid. By default, nobody, the price disappears into the ether
# - price <scriptedprice>: listed in \common\prices\ and referenced by name (like price:<price_id>) or as a result of a script (like scope:target.price)
# - price_modifier <script value>: multiplies the price; scope:actor is the country, scope:recipient, scope:target, scope:target_1, scope:target_2....etc
# - payer <scripted country>: script to determine who is paying the price. By default, the proposer
# - payee <scripted country>: script to determine who gets paid. By default, nobody, the price disappears into the ether
# - requires_vote <trigger>: returns yes if this resolution must be voted on, no if it can be actioned unilaterally
# - requires_explicit_votes <yes/no>: does this require all votes to be explicitly set or do we just take the current opinion (basically, we use this for elections as they happen all of a sudden and we don't need to go through waiting for all countries to cast votes explicitly)
# - votes <scripted value>: value script to get the number of votes each country has. scope:actor is the country we're calculating a score for; scope:proposer is the proposer country; scope:recipient, scope:target, scope:target_1, scope:target_2....etc
# - total_votes_needed <scripted value>: [optional] value script to get the voting threshold for winning the vote. scope:actor is the country we're calculating a score for; scope:proposer is the proposer country; scope:recipient, scope:target, scope:target_1, scope:target_2....etc
# - should_finalize_vote <trigger>: determines if the vote should be finalized right now. Before this trigger is run, any deadline is checked, deadlines take precedence over this trigger. Additional parameters are available here - scope:total_votes_needed is the total votes needed to win (if that is specified), scope:total_votes_available is the total number of votes that can be cast, and highest_vote is the total of whoever has the current highest vote. These can be used to implement voting thresholds.
# - select_trigger: can add multiple of these to allow selection of targets/parameters for the action. They get stored in scope:target, scope:target_1, scope:target_2....etc
# 				   PerformGenericAction takes the user through selecting these targets
#				   format: 
#						looking_for_a = character/location/province/area/region/country/value/boolean etc
#						target_flag = what you want to call this target in the scope (e.g. target, target_1, target_province etc.) Then later you'll use this name to reference what was selected here. If left out it will default to target, target_1, target_2, target_3 etc
#						source = actor/recipient/target/target_1/target_2/target_3/target_4/world

#                       default_sort = key of the sort you want the selection to default to. With nothing it will default to the first sort column. The columns you have are specified in columns = above, the sort keys for the sorts are in \common\attribute_columns\
#                       none_available_msg_key = key of the localization used when there are no available targets to choose from (optional)

# - cooldown = { type = <any tag> days/weeks/months/years = <integer> } adds a cooldown for the action during which time it cannot be performed again
#
# To use the action in GUI script, use this sort of thing:
#
#action_button_default = {
#	title = "<optional title for action tooltip>"
#	description = "<optional description for action tooltip. By default, uses the generic action description>"
#	effects = "<optional description of the effects for action tooltip. By default, uses the generic action effects but you can override>"
#	conditions = "<optional description of the conditions for action tooltip. By default, uses the generic action trigger but you can override>"
#	root = "[GUI script to get the country that is contemplating the action]"
#	actor = "[GUI script to get the country that is proposing/voting on the action]"
#   proposer = "[GUI script to get the country that proposed the action]"
#	recipient = "[<GUI script to get the recipient of the action>]"
#	target = "[<GUI script to get the target of the action>]"
#   target = ... (you can add as many targets as you want in case the action has several)
#	left_action = "<id of the action to perform with a click of the left button>"
#	left_click_and_hold_action = "<id of the action to perform with a click and hold of the left button>"
#	right_action = "<id of the action to perform with a click of the right button>"
#	right_click_and_hold_action = "<id of the action to perform with a click and hold of the right button>"
#}
#
# Useful triggers/effects:
# - resolution:<key> - scopes to the resolution
# - any_active_resolution - list for international organization scope, a list of all resolutions currently being voted on
# - set_vote = { 
#       resolution = <resolution>
#       voter = <country>
#       vote = <whatever they want to vote for from the last select_trigger>
#   } - sets a vote for a country
#
# As for message types that get sent to the player, the format is as follows. At the very least, the generic version should be provided. If the more specific ones are available, they will be used.
# Generic catch-all message: PERFORM_ + Key + _ACTION e.g. PERFORM_do_some_stuff_ACTION
#
# These are added as message types in gui/messagetypes.txt.
#
# The text for them needs to be added as localizations. There are plenty of examples, all the localizations use the stem of the action type as the basis for the localization key.
#
# When the player does the action: WE_PERFORM_ + Key + _ACTION e.g. WE_PERFORM_throw_tomatoes_ACTION
# When another country does it: OTHER_PERFORMS_ + Key + _ACTION e.g. OTHER_PERFORMS_rain_dance_ACTION
# When another country does it to us: ACTION_ + Key + _PERFORMED_ON_US e.g. ACTION_declare_war_PERFORMED_ON_US
#
# In the strings for these messages, in addition to being able to use the scope variables in the strings, you can use the following presets:
# $ACTION$ - the name of the action
# $EFFECT$ - the effect of the action
# $DESC$ - the action description (<action_tag>_desc)
