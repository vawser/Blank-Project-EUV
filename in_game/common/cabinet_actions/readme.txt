# allow: trigger for whether the action can start (root = country)
# years:
# months:
# weeks:
# days: <ints> all used to define how long it takes to become fully implemented. Modifiers will be scaled by how much of this time is completed.
# progress: <script value> returns the current progress of the action
# on_activate: <effect> fired when the action is chosen (root = cabinet, scope:actor = country, scope:target, scope:target_1 etc)
# on_fully_activated: <effect> fired when the action's implementation reaches 100% (instant if there's no time delay) (root = cabinet, scope:actor = country, scope:target, scope:target_1 etc)

# country_modifier: <scaled and triggered modifier (scale = script for the scale, potential_trigger = trigger for if the modifier applies)> which is applied to whole countries
# province_modifier: <scaled and triggered modifier (scale = script for the scale, potential_trigger = trigger for if the modifier applies)> which is applied to provinces
# location_modifier: <scaled and triggered modifier (scale = script for the scale, potential_trigger = trigger for if the modifier applies)> which is applied to locations
# ai_will_do = effect script for the AI to use, scope:actor is the country, scope:recipient, scope:target, scope:target_1, scope:target_2....etc
