# Building Types
#
# ATTRIBUTES
# - build_time: <integer> building time in days
# - employment_size: <float> how many people can be employed there. 1 = 1000 people
# - output: <float> how much of the produced good can be output per building level
# - is_foreign: <yes/no> is the building type able to be built in foreign lands
# - in_empty: <empty/owned/any> empty = can build in non-owned locations only; owned = can build in owned locations only; any = can build anywhere
# - stronger_power_projection: <yes/no> if yes, and you're building it in a foreign-owned location, you need stronger power projection than the location's owner to build it
# - need_good_relation: <yes/no> if yes, and you're building it in a foreign-owned location, you need good relations with the location's owner to build it
# - conversion_religion: <religion> religion that pops are converted to by this building
# - pop_type: <pop type> the pop type employed in this building
# - category: <building category> building category tag
# - construction_demand: what goods are required during construction
# - possible_production_methods = { <procuction_methods>}: production methods for each slot. (add as many lists as you desire)
# - unique_production_methods = { x = { } } , defining unique production methods scripted directly into the building
# - obsolete: <building type> what building type this one makes obsolete
# - price: <price> cost of creating the building
# - destroy_price: <price> price to destroy the building
# - estate: <estate type> what estate can build the building
# - max_levels: <scripted integer> maximum levels the building can be upgraded to (root = location, scope:owner = building owner, scope:builder = who's paying)
# - allow: <trigger> can the building be built in the location (root = location) (think of this as an "enabled" check)
# - location_potential: <trigger> can the building be built in the location (root = location) (think of this as a "visible" check)
# - country_potential: <trigger> can the building be built by the country (root = country) (think of this as a "visible" check)
# - can_destroy: <trigger> can the building be destroyed in the location (root = location, actor = destroyer, building = building)
# - remove_if: <trigger> will the building be auto-destroyed in the location (root = building)
# - capital_modifier: <modifier> modifier applied to the location if built in the capital (multiplied by building level and goods access)
# - capital_country_modifier: <modifier> modifier applied to the country if built in the capital (multiplied by building level and goods access)
# - modifier: <modifier> modifier applied to the location (multiplied by building level and goods access)
# - raw_modifier: <modifier> modifier applied to the location (not scaled)
# - market_center_modifier: <modifier> modifier applied to the location if built in a market center (multiplied by building level and goods access)
# - pop_size_created: <float> creates a pop of this size for the new building, taking it from your capital (for foreign buildings only)
# - increase_per_level_cost: <per cent> each new level added increases the cost by this percentage. So 0.5 = 50% more expensive per extra level
# - <location rank>: <yes/no> location ranks that the building can be built in
# - on_built = { <effects> }
# - on_destroyed = { <effects> }
# - always_add_demands = <yes/no> when set to yes building will need full demand even if doesn't employ all workers
# - custom_tags = { <strings> } #A list of custom strings to use to identify that building type
# - AI_ignore_available_worker_flag = <yes/no> AI will build this building even if it is lacking the required pop type
# - important_for_AI = <yes/no> When set it makes the AI use more performance trying to find a suitable place to build this
