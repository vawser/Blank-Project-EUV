#-------------------
# Modifiers
#-------------------
Define a local modifier:
local_<disease_tag>_impact_modifier

# Which you can use on locations to lessen or augment the impact the disease has there. E.g. a hospital might carry local_my_disease_imapct_modifier = -0.9.

#-------------------
# Notes
#-------------------
spread:
   no threshold for spreading from a location
   a disease will not spread to a location if:
       the destination location is not populated
       if there's an embargo between the two nations that own the locations
       if the destination location already has at least 50% presence
       if the destination location has stagnated
   disease will spread from a location to (assuming that the above criteria are met):
       its neighbors (general people movement)
       its market centre (people going to market)
       locations it trades with if it's a market centre (merchants going to and from)
       the location owner's capital (people going to the big city)
