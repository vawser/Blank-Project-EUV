message = yes/no whether or not to show a message about this interaction
sound = sound to use for the action

is_consort_action = yes/no, whether this is an interaction on your consort
potential = trigger, scope:actor is the country attempting to perform the action
allow = trigger, scope:actor is the country attempting to perform the action
price = a scripted standard price, listed in \common\prices\ and referenced by name (like price:<price_id>) or as a result of a script (like scope:target.price)
price_modifier = calculated value, multiplies the price; scope:actor is the country, scope:recipient, scope:target, scope:target_1, scope:target_2....etc
payer = script to determine who is paying the price. By default, the actor
payee = script to determine who gets paid. By default, nobody, the price disappears into the ether
ai_tick = <never/daily/monthly> use to ban the AI from using an action that is already handled in code OR to indicate how often to process
ai_tick_frequency = <scripted value> how many ticks until next. script to determine how often this action should be checked for each country. root is the country. This is just a per-country check. So ai_tick = monthly and ai_tick_frequency = 6 means "check every 6 months"
show_message = no, optional, to prevent messages showing
show_message_to_target = no, optional, to prevent messages to show to the target
should_execute_price = no, optional, to prevent the price of the action to be paid
